# Wellington here ðŸ‘‹

Quality Engineer from Brazil who spends way too much time making sure things don't break in production (and occasionally succeeding).

I'm that guy who gets genuinely excited when a test catches a bug before it reaches users. Been working with test automation for a while now, and honestly? I still get a kick out of watching a good CI/CD pipeline run smoothly.

## What I'm up to

Currently breaking things professionally so they don't break accidentally later. My day usually involves:

- Writing tests that actually matter (not just for coverage numbers)
- Setting up CI/CD pipelines that don't make developers cry
- Diving into DevOps stuff because monitoring is addictive once you start

When I'm not staring at test results, I'm probably working on games. There's something about creating interactive experiences that just clicks with me - maybe it's the instant feedback loop, or maybe I just like making things that are fun.

## Side project that keeps me busy

Built **[Pokemotion](https://pokemotion.online)** because why not combine two things I love? It's a game where I get to practice everything I preach about quality - automated testing, proper deployment, monitoring, the works.

Sometimes I spend more time debugging the deployment pipeline than actually playing the game, but that's the fun part, right? ðŸ˜…

## Tech I actually use

**Testing:** Cypress â€¢ Selenium â€¢ Postman â€¢ Jasmine  
**DevOps:** Docker â€¢ Jenkins â€¢ Azure â€¢ Grafana  
**Code:** JavaScript â€¢ C# â€¢ Java â€¢ Vue.js â€¢ Unity

## When I'm not coding

You'll probably find me fishing (best debugging happens away from the screen), listening to whatever's on - could be jazz, could be funk, helps me think. And yes, I'm one of those people who codes better with coffee in hand.
